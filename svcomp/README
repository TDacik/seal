# SEAL static analyzer

This is a submission of the SEAL static analyzer for SV-COMP 2026.

The analyser is implemented as a plugin of the [Frama-C](https://frama-c.com/) platform
and its source code is available at [github](https://github.com/pepega007xd/seal).

## Usage

Analysis of a program is done using the entrypoint script:

```sh
./seal-entrypoint.py [-machdep=x86_32|x86_64] source.c
```
The `machdep` option specifies the target architecture, with values corresponding
to ILP_32 and LP64 as used in SV-COMP, respectively.
